<h1>Chapter 2 </h1>
<p>This book seems to be the guide to style that all Computer Science professors
have used to tell us how to style our code but never the book itself.
I remember Mikey G telling us copying and pasting is a terrible way to do things,
"your code will blow up" he would say. This goes along with DRY where if you use
copy paste then you could easily repeat yourself unintentionally. 
</p>

<p2>Coding is basically typing engineering. Use orthagonal design to make systems
independent, proto-type or use tracers, flexibility and reversability are a must...
and test everything ruthlessly! </p2>
